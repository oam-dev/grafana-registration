**This repository is no longer maintained. KubeVela has changed the registration of grafana from CRD mode to Aggregated Server mode in [vela-prism](https://github.com/kubevela/prism#grafana-related-apis). If you would like to use the CRD (operator) mode, we recommend you to see [grafana-operator](https://github.com/grafana-operator/grafana-operator/) project.**
